# Movie Review Classification Project
This project is an implementation of a movie review classification system using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to predict whether a given movie review is positive or negative based on its text.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews collected from various sources. It contains both positive and negative reviews labeled with their respective sentiments.

# Requirements
To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:
1. Python
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. scikit-learn

# Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Download the movie reviews dataset and place it in the project directory.
3. Open the movie_review_classification.ipynb notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the model and make predictions on new reviews.
5. View the evaluation metrics, including the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
6. Feel free to explore and modify the code to improve the model's performance or adapt it to your specific needs.

# Credits
This project was created as part of the NLP - Natural Language Processing with Python course on Udemy, taught by Jose Portilla.
